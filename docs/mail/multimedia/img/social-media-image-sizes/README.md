## Twitter Image Sizing Tips

Profile Photo: 400 x 400 pixels / Displays at 200 x 200 pixels (a maximum 100 KB file size)

It is often said that the “first impression is the last impression”!
Your Twitter profile picture is your main identification mark that will be visible to everyone. It will be visible on your home page, on the Twitter stream of your followers whenever you Tweet and so on.
Since it represents you or your brand, the image should be of the highest quality.

Header Photo: 1500 x 500 pixels (a maximum 10 MB file size)

You can use an eye-catchy, creative image for your high-resolution header photo on your Twitter profile page. As a business, your Twitter page header photo should be in sync with your logo, tagline and brand.

 

In-stream Photo: 440 x 220 pixels (a maximum 5 MB file size for photos and 3 MB file size for animated gifs)

You can post up to four pictures along with your tweets on this platform. For every in-stream picture, an image link is created which takes up the Twitter character space. You simply need to maintain the 2:1 ratio of the images which can be reduced to a smaller version to effectively fit your follower’s stream.

## Image Sizing Advice for Facebook

Cover Photo: 820 x 310 pixels (a preferred maximum file size of 100 KB)
You can edit and add creative images as your cover photo that represents you or your business in the correct sense. – Appear on page at 820 x 310 pixels
– Anything less will be stretched.
– Minimum size of 399 x 150 pixels.
– Smartphones display as 640 x 360
– For best results, upload an RGB  / JPG file less than 100 KB.
– Images with a logo or text maybe best as a PNG file.

Profile Picture: 180 x 180 pixels

Unlike the cover photo, which only appears on your Facebook page, your Facebook profile picture will be seen on your page, on posts where you comment, on the timelines of others where you post messages, in search results of Facebook’s Open Graph and so on. In short, it represents you at most places on the largest social networking platform.


Shared Image: 1200 x 630 pixels

## Image Sizing Guidelines for Google+

Profile Image: 250 x 250 pixels

Again, this picture will be your identity across the Google+ network. Even though the dimensions are for a square image, your Google+ profile picture appears as a circle. So, you need to take special care of how your image looks without the important parts being cut out.

Cover Picture: 1 080 x 608 pixels

You can use a large picture representing your brand, logo and business tagline as your Google+ cover image.

Shared Image: 497 x 373 pixels

You can share images on your Google+ posts and indicate the specific “circles” with whom you want to share the image and for whom it may be more relevant. Remember, such images (along with the associated text) are likely to turn up in the Google search engine for search queries related to your posts or business.


## Instagram Image Sizing Rules

Profile Picture: 110 x 110 pixels

Photo Size: 1080 x 1080 pixels

Video to Stories: 750 x 1334 pixels

The maximum duration of the video should be 10 seconds.

Portrait Size: 1080 x 1350 pixels

Instagram portrait size recommended: 1080px x 1350px. However, Instagram will show it as a 600 x 749 pixel image.

Photo Thumbnails: 161 x 161 pixels

For all types of Instagram images, you need to maintain an aspect ratio of 1:1. So, all your images will appear in square dimensions. You need to take special care with the image quality because limited text content is shared on this platform. It is more about the pictures and visuals!

## Recommended Image Sizes for Pinterest


Profile Picture: 165 x 165 pixels

A Pinterest profile picture may not be as important as that of Facebook or Twitter profile pictures. However, you still need to use a nice one. After all, anyone who arrives at your board or pins through the keyword search will probably have a look at your profile too.

Board Display Image: 222 x 150 pixels

Use eye-catchy images for posting on the relevant Pinterest boards.

Pin Sizes: a width of 238 pixels (with scaled height)

Though these are the dimensions for your Pinterest pins, expanded pins will have a minimum width of 600 pixels. You can post larger images (as only the width is fixed, while the length can be scaled further up) for better engagement and more re-pins or likes.

 
## Optimisation Rules for Tumblr Image Sizes

Profile Image: 128 x 128 pixels

You can use a good looking square profile picture that visually represents you or your business on Tumblr. It will appear on your profile page, next to the button to “follow” you when someone lands on your page and as thumbnails next to your posts in your follower’s feeds.

Image Posts: 500 x 750 pixels

The sizes are optimised for the different platforms as YouTube videos are often streamed using any of the above mentioned platforms. Also, the video channel cover image should tell your viewers more about the kind of videos that they will probably be able to view on your channel.

Video Uploads: 1280 x 760 pixels

You know that YouTube is a video sharing site and not an image sharing one. So, you need to maintain this resolution (about 16:9 aspect ratio) for the videos that you upload.
